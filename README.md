### Hi there 👋

I am a full stack web developer from Ontario, Canada. While my more "traditional" academic background is in economics and finance, through my own interests and hobbies, I fell in love with programming and building. I am currently looking for any opportunities to continue my journey and learn/grow as a developer!

Quick facts:
- Born and raised in Canada 🇨🇦
- Currently learning fullstack web dev through [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com):
  - Ruby and Ruby on Rails 💎 🚂
  - HTML, CSS, React, Javascript ☕️
- Looking for opportunities as a fullstack/backend developer 👨🏻‍💻
- Fun fact: Named after the Brazilian Formula 1 driver, Ayrton Senna 🏎
