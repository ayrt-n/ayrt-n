### Hi there 👋

I am a full stack software engineer from Ontario, Canada. While orignally going to school for economics and finance, through my own interests and hobbies, I fell in love with programming and building. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Carleton University and looking for entry-level / internship opportunities!

Experienced with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React 💎 🚂 🐍 ☕️
